# Employee Polls Project

# Project Description

The "Employee Polls" project is my implementation of the final project for the Udacity React Nanodegree program. It is a web application that allows employees to participate in polls and surveys related to their work. Employees can create their own polls, respond to polls created by other employees, and view the results of polls. This project is built using React, Redux, and React Router, and the UI is styled using the Tailwind CSS framework.

# How to Run the Project

To run the project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Once you have Node.js and npm installed, follow these steps:

- Clone the project repository to your local machine.
- Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
- Install the project dependencies by running npm install.
- Start the development server by running npm start.
- Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/.
